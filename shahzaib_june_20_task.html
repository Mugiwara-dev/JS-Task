        /* What is Javascript and write down where it is used? */
        /*  JavaScript is a high - level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language
            that is used to make a website interactive and dynamic.It is primarily used
            for web development, but it can also be used in non - web environments such
            as server - side scripting and game development. JavaScript is commonly used
            for adding interactivity to HTML pages, creating animations, validating user
            input, manipulating the DOM, creating dynamic web content, and building web-based
            applications like libraries and frameworks, client - side scripting for web applications.*/

        //What is the logical operator for "not equal value or not equal type" statement?
        /*The logical operator for "not equal value or not equal type" statement 
        is !== in JavaScript. It compares the values and types of the operands
        returning true if they are not equal in either value or type
        otherwise it returns false. 
        For example, the expression 5 !== '5' is true.*/

        /*A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task
        and it can be called or executed multiple times from different places in 
        the code. The scope of a function determines the accessibility of variables 
        inside and outside the function. Variables inside a function are only accessible 
        within the function's scope.*/

        each key-value pair is separated by a comma.*/

        /*The expression 100 == '101' will evaluate to false because the == operator
        in JavaScript performs type coercion before making the comparison. 
        In this case, the number 100 is being compared to the string '101'.

        The expression 100 != '100' will evaluate to false because, as mentioned 
        before, the != operator also performs type coercion. The string '100' can be
        converted to the number 100, so the comparison between the number 100 and 
        the string '100' will result in false.

        In both cases, the comparisons result in false

        Coercion, in the context of programming languages, refers to the automatic 
        conversion or transformation of one data type to another data type.*/
